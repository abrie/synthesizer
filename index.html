<h1>About Synthesizer<h1>
<p>
    This is the front end to an algorithmic composition engine named Feelers. Feelers is under development and this open front end serves as a prototype sandbox. The engine source is not currently available to the public, but if you would like to try it out then a binary copy might be available. You'll need OSX 10.8 and a synthesizer (software or hardware).
